# Welcome!

This project is for developing and updating my own portfolio website
It includes my past projects and new projects that I've completed. This is to showcase my skills and development as a front-end engineer and as a developer. 

# Purpose
I created this project and website to cultivate a professional background and identity as an aspiring front-end engineer. It's important for me to really see my progress over time so that, I am consistent and disciplined with how I grow as a developer. This also serves to show future recruiters what I am capable of should I apply to their company and desired role. Being self-taught, building my credibility and expertise is highly important to me. It helps to show myself how much I can do and will be able to do and also shows recuiters that I am very much skilled for the role I am applying for.

I also love the fact that I have full control over this project and I can experiment with my design process, improve my eye for design, and develop better habits as a developer
